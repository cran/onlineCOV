Description: Implement a new stopping rule to detect anomaly in the covariance structure of high-dimensional online data. The detection procedure can be applied to Gaussian or non-Gaussian data with a large number of components. Moreover, it allows both spatial and temporal dependence in data. The dependence can be estimated by a data-driven procedure. The level of threshold in the stopping rule can be determined at a pre-selected average run length. More detail can be seen in Li, L. and Li, J. (2020) "Online Change-Point Detection in High-Dimensional Covariance Structure with Application to Dynamic Networks." <arXiv:1911.07762>.
